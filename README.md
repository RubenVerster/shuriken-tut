# Boilerplate HTML/SCSS

This repo is used to clone a boilerplate file structure for creating basic web pages with HTML and SCSS
There is also a proper SCSS file architecture implemented

node-sass is used to compile your SCSS down to a single page of CSS that is then imported into the HTML file
Check the package.json for the commands you can use to compile your SCSS to CSS
